Real-time analytics platform using Snowflake &amp; SQL

**Business Problem:**
E-commerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart, or Shopify often struggle with:

- Ingesting both structured (CSV) and semi-structured (JSON) data into Snowflake
- Using Snowflake's VARIANT datatype to handle complex JSON data
- Creating file formats and loading data into Snowflake tables
- Designing real-time transformations using Streams & Tasks
- Building a dashboard for KPIs like Revenue, Inventory, and Sales Trends

  ## ðŸ“¦ Datasets Used

- Structured: Orders, Products, Customers, Inventory  
- Semi-structured: Product Reviews, Web Logs (JSON)
